		<head>1,500 Attend Birth Control Lecture Here</head>
		<head type="sub">Margaret Sanger Delivers Arguments for Dissemination of Such
			Information</head>
		<p><q who="RTD">While the <org reg="United States Government">Federal Government</org> will
				give you a truck load of information on how to raise pigs and chickens, they will
				give you give years in <place reg="Atlanta, GA">Atlanta</place> and a fine of $5,000
				if you even tell anybody, through the mail, about birth control clinics operating
				legally in <place>Virginia</place>, Mrs. Margaret Sanger, founder of the modern
				birth control movement, told a large audience here last night in protesting against
				what she said was discrimination against mothers and children.</q></p>
		<p><q who="RTD">Mrs. Sanger set forth many arguments why birth control information should be
				made readily accessible, but gave no information on how to accomplish such control.
				Dr. Fred Wampler of the Medical College of Virginia presided and presented the
				speaker.</q></p>
		<p><q who="RTD">Summarizing the case, Mrs. Sanger gave seven reasons why birth control
				should be practiced. They were: 1. By parents who have transmittable disease. 2. In
				case of women who have tuberculosis, heart disease or some temporary ailment. 3.
				Where parents, though normal themselves apparently, already have brought into the
				world abnormal and defective children. 4. Adolescents. Early marriage, she said, was
				desirable, but the young should not become parents. The girls should be 22 years
				old, the boys 23 for complete development. 5. For the purpose of spacing children so
				there will be two or three years between births. 6. The economic side of the
				question; the father’s earning power. It is unfair, she argued, for parents to have
				children they can do nothing for or for older children to have to stunt their youth
				working to feed their brothers and sisters, “<q>their parents’ children.</q>” 7.
				What she said was the necessity for young people after marriage to postpone at least
				two years after marriage the having of any children because they need the time for
				mental and spiritual adjustment. Premature parents, she said, found it harder in
				modern times to get along . Therefore contraceptive information should be available
				to young married people because individuals should be able to say what size their
				families should be.</q></p>
		<p><q who="RTD">Birth control, Mrs. Sanger said, can be accomplished in three ways, one,
				continence or celibacy, the method approved by the <org reg="Roman Catholic Church"
					>Catholic Church</org>. This method, however, should not be forced on most
				people as religious dogma, particularly, she said, because psychiatrists have found
				continence was not good for most people. The second method was through sterilization
				by radium or x-ray, a method approved by Virginia and thirteen other States for
				epileptics and other persons who would transmit their physical and mental handicaps
				to children.</q></p>
		<p><q who="RTD">The third was by chemical or mechanical contraceptives, the description of
				which now is classed by Federal law as “obscenity.” She stressed the advantages of
				small families–-the longer school terms possible; better nourishment, and less
				overcrowding, low wages and unemployables. Birth control information, she found was
				generally denied the poor even when accessible to more prosperous people.</q> “No
			matter what laws we may make or what we may do, there will always be some kind of child
			labor in large families,” she said, telling of 3-year-olds seen in
				<place>Colorado</place> and <place>California</place> beet fields. Only
				<place>Chile</place> has a worse maternal mortality rate than this country, although
			in 1929 we spent nine billions on maternal and child health. About 22,000 mothers a year
			die of preventable causes usually resulting from pregnancy and more than 200,000 infants
			die as a result of poverty and neglect.“</p>
		<p>"They will not attack the problem at the root,” <q who="RDT">she said.</q> "Children
			should have passports to give every child a sound body and mind. Our immigration laws
			forbid idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, epileptics, psychopathic and insane or
			diseased persons, prostitutes and so on. Why should the same types come in through the
			birthrate?"</p>
