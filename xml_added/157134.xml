		<p>I have the honor to open the AMERICAN CONFERENCE ON BIRTH CONTROL AND NATIONAL RECOVERY,
			which is held under the auspices of the <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation
				for Birth Control</org>, Inc.</p>
		<p>This is the 2nd National Conference to be held in this country-- and to this I bid you a
			cordial and hearty welcome. It is the first ever held in the <place
				reg="Washington, D.C.">District of Columbia</place>, where we have had cooperation
			and help on an extensive scale.</p>
		<p>
			<add>appropriate</add>
			<add>where all our troubles began 60 years ago</add>
		</p>
		<p>(Introducing Mrs. Dryden)</p>
		<p>I want to now introduce you to the Chairman of the <org>Reception Committee of the
				District of Columbia</org>, whose help and assistance, whose guidance and sound
			advice, has helped to make this Conference the success that we hope it is going to
			be.</p>
		<p>I have the pleasure of introducing <person reg="Dryden, Lelia">Mrs. John F.
				Dryden</person>.</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>(Response to Mrs. Dryden.)</p>
		<p>I thank you, Mrs. Dryden, on behalf of the National Committee on Federal Legislation and
			on behalf of the delegates and speakers of this Conference.</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>The Birth Control movement had its beginning in this country in 1914-- just 20 years ago.
			During that time there have been more than 11 State, 6 Regional, and 6 International
			Conferences (besides the most recent one in <place reg="London, England">London</place>
			last November, called the Asiatic Conference, which was preliminary to the work <add>the
				international clubs</add> we are planning to do in the Orient in 1935. we
				<add>now</add>
			<del>emerge</del>
			<add>come to</add> the 20th Anniversary of the Modern Birth Control Movement not only in
			this country but throughout the world.</p>
		<p>While the problem of population was recognized by intelligent thinkers, especially in
				<place>England</place>, since the days of <person reg="Malthus, Thomas Robert"
				>Malthus</person>, the slogan of the Neo-Malthusians was to "Educate the Educators";
			while the slogan of the Birth Control movement is to "Educate the Masses".</p>
		<p>We have gone a good way toward <add>accomplish</add> our goal and it is safe to say that
			the masses are ready and desirous to receive this <add>B.C.</add> information when it is
			made available for their use.</p>
		<p>This knowledge should not remain the privilege of the well-to-do. It should become the
			right of the millions of poor, worried, struggling mothers who ask only the right to
			knowelge that they may free themselves from intolerable conditions akin to slavery, and
			have a chance to develop <add>bodies minds &amp; souls</add> and to pursue happiness for
			themselves and their children.</p>
		<p>Laws are in the way to this objective. We must enlighten our <del>legislators</del>
			<add>lawmakers</add> to this effect. It should be the duty of our government to provide
			for the diseased, the inefficient, the overburdened and unfit, and others who may desire
				it<add>,</add> the best information on contracepti<del>on</del><add>ves</add>
			available.</p>
		<p>If the Government will give the same consideration to the forgotten Woman that it has
			given to the Forgotten man-- we may yet rectify the deplorable situation created by
				<add>the Comstock laws</add> our<add>,</add> differential birthrate.</p>
		<p>The past twenty years have been years of struggle against injustice, intolerance,
			arrogance and <del>legal</del><add>overwhelming</add> obstacles. But in spite of
			opposition from such quarters<add>,</add> as well as from others who should have
			supported this cause, the movement has advanced rapidly and <add>has</add> gained
			millions of friends and advocates. It is gaining momentum every year, <add>&amp; in
				every country</add> and the time is not far off when this government will be called
			upon to face the question of birth control <add>for the common people</add> and
			sterilization <del>as well</del>
			<add>for the feebleminded &amp; unfit</add>. We can lay at the doors of the opponents of
			this movement a large part of the misery and poverty arising from the huge
				<del>arrag</del><add>array</add> of unemployed, whose suffering, hopelessness, and
			loss of self respect have spread like an epidemic thruoughout the Nation.</p>
		<p>We are gathered here today, workers in the field from 25 states, to discuss some of the
				<del>t</del><add>g</add>reatest problems that are now confronting a new world. Many
				<add>of us</add> believe that the advance of the birth control movement<add>,</add>
			means the advance of civilization, and that the direction this movement shall take from
			now on, shall decide the future of the country's welfare.</p>
		<p>We are here to help in its direction; we are here to discuss the problems constantly
			arising within the movement itself as well as from without. We are here to share our
			discoveries with each other, <add>to share</add> what we have learned from our
			experience; and we are here to awaken <add>a keener</add> realization and
				interest<add>,</add> in these problems in the public <add>and</add> to strengthen
			our faith<add>in the future</add> and to broaden our vision that it may embrace the
			entire world.</p>
		<p>When the history of the <add>BC</add> movement shall be written, high tribute will be
			paid to the courageous stand taken by the scientists of this period.</p>
		<p>(Introducing <person reg="Fairchild, Henry Pratt">Prof. Fairchild</person>)</p>
		<p>Sociologists, economists and biologists <add>who</add>
			<del>have</del> from the beginning <add>have</add> thrown the weight of their influence
			with this movement. We have with us today many distunguished men and women in various
			fields of science-- from many walks of life-- and I have the pleasure to introduce you
			to one who has for many years lent the presige of his name, and given of his time and
			energy to the advancement of this <del>cause</del>
			<add>work</add>. I am glad to say he will preside over this meeting; he will introduce
			the speakers, and will summarize the discussion... Professor Henry Pratt Fairchild.</p>
