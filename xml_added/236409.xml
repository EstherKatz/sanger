		<p>Now 73 has been the ??? mass leader of <place>India</place> for nearly a quarter of a
			century. since 1919--</p>
		<p>He has dramatized his leadership by his campaign for the revival of hand spinning &amp;
			cottage industries &amp; the use of home spun cotton cloth. All a ??? flow against the
			principal British export to India Gandhi has been a leader not only of the poverty
			stricken ignorant peasant but the chosen leader of industrialists, landlords, &amp;
			students &amp; professional classes. Middle educated classes, intellectuals also Indian
			financiers</p>
		<p>His outstanding contribution to India is that he inspired the semi-starved illiterate
			weaponless millions of India to a new confidence &amp; new hope &amp; gave them the
			value &amp; effectiveness of mass action even tho that action was passive &amp; non
			resistance. He taught them in true Hindu religion to endure beatings, starvation,
			imprisonment, physical injuries &amp; tortures, yes even death without yielding.</p>
		<p>My invitation to India--</p>
		<p>The <org reg="All India Woman's Conference">All Indian Womans Congress</org> to keep
			getting a resolution passed to place the teaching of contraception in Public Health
			Servces in all communities throughout India-- a noted &amp; advanced step courageously
			out usually in any other organized womans agency ??? in the world-- Representing
			millions of Indian women all classes, all religions-- on of the most brilliant groups of
			women I ever met anywhere-- parallel only with the modern women of China--</p>
		<p>Met at the ??? in <place reg="Bombay, India">Bombay</place> by ??? of Gandhi &amp;
			representatives of various organizations </p>
		<p>Note from Gandhi-- "no masters, no servants"</p>
		<p>India a land of contrasts</p>
		<p>the highest mountains the</p>
		<p>five thousand years of ??? --culture--</p>
		<p>Every form of organized life political &amp; social has been lived there-- &amp; over
			tried out &amp; more often abandoned-- you can find out any question you might like to
			know.</p>
		<p>Gandhi left the ??? Congress as a member in 1934--</p>
		<p>How is it he has so much influence on the Congress</p>
		<p>Would you characterize Gandhi as one with a love of ??? women?</p>
		<p>Do you think Gandhi's astuteness is expressed in the Salt March 1930--</p>
		<p>entitles him to political leadership as compared to ???</p>
		<p>??? <add>Sir ???</add> is ??? for the government seemed in the face of it very reasonable
			considering the large religious elements he had to contend with. Why rejected</p>

				reg="East India Company">East India Co.</org> in 1858 &amp; they assumed a debt of
			70 million pounds in 1914-- $1,350,000</p>
		<p>As these developed for British ??? India became politically unified awaking to her own
			wrongs &amp; desires</p>
		<p>The British policy toward India throughout the 19th century was that India was to be
			reduced to an agricultural country so that an Indian market for British goods could be
			developed.</p>
		<p>This manufacturing industry had to be curtailed &amp; the production &amp; export of raw
			materials in India had to expand.</p>
		<p>This policy ??? the construction of R. R. roads, ports, postal &amp; telegraphic
			services, irrigation projects, educational system on the English order to train clerks
			&amp; subordinate members of the civil service-- a ??? system ??? sums &amp; British
			capital ???</p>
