        <body id="Autograph_draft_speech">
            <p>By the title of the subject to be discussed tonight, I would not have you think that
                I have originated a special propaganda of which I have a special monopoly nor would
                I have you think I have cornered the market as Americans say but I simply wish to
                show that there is a special side of our present day propaganda which should receive
                more of our attention as propagandists and there is always room in a field like the
                Socialist or Anarchist philosophy for some of us to lay special stress on &amp;
                concentrate our work on special parts of the whole-- My work on the nursing field in
                    <name type="place" reg="United States">U.S.A.</name> gave me my first
                introduction to the <del>physical</del> ignorance of the working women
                    <unclear>concerning</unclear> the physical care of their own bodies, or its
                physiological function.</p>
            <p>Tho I was rocked in the cradle of Socialism--for my father was one of the early
                pioneers of Socialist thought in USA yet with my nursing experience among women--I
                could see the <reg resp="MSPP">great</reg> undermining &amp; weakening of that class
                both physically &amp; mentally <reg resp="MSPP">through</reg> ignorance of the care
                of their own bodies &amp; especially the physiological functioning of the
                    <del>sex</del>
                <add>generative</add> organs.</p>
            <p>In USA, you are all aware of our world famous Puritanism which has made any mention
                of sex a prison offense &amp; always reminds me of that story of which you are no
                doubt familiar but which bears repeating here. The story of the queen of <name
                    type="place">Spain</name> travelling <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/>
                through the rural districts to one of the provinces had need to pass through a
                manufacturing town made famous for its excellent production of hosiery &amp;
                gloves.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of the town being simple &amp; loving people desired to please the
                lady &amp; show honor to her by presenting to her some of their best &amp; choicest
                productions. The magistrate of the town assembled the people together to receive the
                queen &amp; presented her with the gifts.</p>
            <p> The Escort bowed low &amp; graciously over the gloves &amp; thanked the people for
                the gift, but declined to accept the stockings by saying "<q who="UNK">never forget
                    that a queen of Spain has no legs.</q>"</p>
            <p>This is quite on a par with our Puritanism in America &amp; it is this barrier that
                must be broken down around the American working girl before you can proceed a step
                in reaching her--</p>
            <p>As you already know there has been throughout the world within the last ten years a
                tremendous awakening in all civilized countries among women. Every where women have
                shown tendencies to overthrow some of the old regulations of society &amp; throw off
                some of the fetters which have held them down so long--</p>
            <p>This awakening has definitely shown itself in two forms--or groups, one the most
                universal the desire for political freedom &amp; recognition or the votes for women
                groups.</p>
            <p>The other &amp; more advanced &amp; more recent is perhaps more psychological in its
                effects but have likewise formed themselves into the Feminist groups.</p>
            <p>I shall not go into detail about the votes for women--woman--for she concerns me
                little &amp; fortunately the working girl has not been greatly enthused in this
                propaganda.</p>
            <p>But sufficient is it to say that as far as I have been able to gather their vision of
                life goes as high as obtaining political positions for women <emph rend="underline"
                    >now today</emph> &amp; aspiring to the lofty attitude of police women,
                detectives, police <unclear>commissioners</unclear> etc. The women of <name
                    type="place" reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago</name> have been able to elect some of
                their sex as police and when the great cloak makers Strike was in progress--the
                working girls found to their great surprise that the policewoman club hurt just as
                much swung from the fair hands of her own sex, as it did from that of the
                policemans-- Again--in <name type="place" reg="New York, NY">N.Y.</name> we have
                    <name type="person" reg="Davis, Katherine Bennett">C.B.D.</name> the Police <reg
                    resp="MSPP">Commissioner</reg>--for years Police Matron in the <name type="org"
                    reg="Bedford Hills Reformatory">Bedford Home for girls</name>. If one could
                describe the hope which sprang into the hearts of the women of the underworld when
                they knew that at last a woman was to be over the Institution wherein they suffered
                so bitterly and what a keen disappointment awaited them-- She went at her work for
                public applause-- Prison was prison and was no joy house--&amp; accordingly she went
                to her job to make prison sentence so hard &amp; cruel that no one would return. She
                refused to allow the inmates to receive outside meals until they were weak &amp; ill
                &amp; unless there was someone outside to help them they were usually fit for a
                hospital-- This &amp; a few such cruelties K.B.D. brought into the Prison--&amp;
                today there is little hope for the hands of a woman--</p>
            <p>In <del>San</del>
                <name type="place">California</name> it is the same. A letter from a friend tells me
                at the last election that the women had gone mad on prohibition that they were going
                to tie the state up so dry, that a working man would have to pay five shillings for
                a <unclear resp="MSPP">prescription</unclear> to keep a pint of cider vinegar in the
                house.</p>
            <p>So much for votes for women. Its not that I deplore votes for women for certainly if
                votes are good for men they are good for women too, but the vision of these women is
                too narrow &amp; <del>voting</del> women as police<del>man</del> matrons etc are the
                same tools in the system as the men are so long as this system
                    <unclear>remains</unclear>.</p>
            <p>The other group of awakened women are the feminists--the basis of which is one of the
                first steps toward woman's emancipation &amp; future development--the ownership
                &amp; control over her own body--</p>
            <p>This movement like all other big vital thoughts, has been cut up &amp; narrowed down
                to such a degree that it is scarcely recognized as Feminism--for instance last year
                in N.Y.C. there was the Feminist Movement launched upon the unsuspecting
                Puritans--but it was Feminism in name only--&amp; ignoring the basis of the whole
                movement, lest it should shock the morals of the people, it began to treat of
                superficial results of its development. For instance--these women--wanted the right
                to work; the right to ignore fashions: the right to keep her own name, &amp; such
                poor longings of a bourgeois class suffering from loss of vitality. I issued a
                working woman's paper called the <title type="journal">Woman Rebel</title>which
                viewed feminism from the working woman's point of view &amp; demanded not the right
                to work, but the right to be lazy, &amp; guaranteed to find seven millions of
                women--laundresses, cloak makers, suit makers, cap--kimona makers scrub women,
                domestics, telephone girls, shop workers, etc etc who would gladly change places
                with these women who wanted the right to work.</p>
            <p>The working girl had never troubled herself about ignoring fashions-- It was
                compulsory on her part.-- She had to--</p>
            <p>The right to keep her own name was a most revolutionary demand for these women to
                make. Instead of Mrs <del>Ma</del> Frank Brown, she wanted the right to be Mrs Mary
                Brown-- Why she must loose her identity in Brown when her own name was Jones--was a
                step too far for them to explain--&amp; why she should tag herself with "Mrs" or a
                wedding ring was too shocking for these blue stocking prudes to think of &amp; when
                I suggested that the basis of feminism was a womans right to be an unmarried
                mother--a stony silence surrounded them &amp; they drew aside their skirts less they
                be defiled by such thoughts.</p>
            <p>So much for the feminists whose program had no place for the working womans
                development, or no thought of her emancipation but fundamentally has a basis for her
                to use of which I shall refer later on.</p>
            <p>If the votes for women &amp; Feminist movements as well as nearly all other movements
                I know of have ignored the working women there has been one kind &amp; ever loving
                friend who has grasped the opportunity to assist her. This friend is the master
                class or the boss--who has subtly &amp; silently instituted in most all the large
                shops &amp; stores where many women work--a Welfare Society, which so far has been a
                wonderful tool in the hands of the boss to blind the workers of their slavery. Heres
                how it works--two thousand women pay into a welfare fund $10 weekly out of their
                wages--for this they receive medical attention when they are ill etc, this amount,
                makes $200 a week, or 50£. out of which they pay 5£. for one nurse &amp; less than
                that to another nurse a week, who binds up hurt fingers etc at once, so they do not
                lose time &amp; get back to work again quickly-- She also tells them that they need
                milk eggs etc, but does not tell the boss that to see that they get an increase in
                wages so as to get them oh no. One nurse attends to the hospital while the other one
                dresses up poorly like the girls themselves &amp; goes among them--she dances with
                them plays the piano in the lunch room, gets them to confide in her, walks home with
                them, and as one of them said to me <del>feels</del> keeps her fingers on the pulse
                of the shop to see there will be no strikes. This is not all. This same Welfare
                League aims to educate these girls &amp; authorizes &amp; pays <del>well</del> good
                prices women to come twice a week to lecture to them-- The lectures consist of all
                kinds of subjects but the tone of all these lectures the key note of all is to
                inject into these girls a slave morality which is the most detrimental teaching of
                today &amp; is not being combated sufficiently to offset the treachery of it.</p>
            <p>Here is some of it--"obedience"--"courtesy" "punctuality" "loyalty"--"honesty" "duty"
                etc. Implicit obedience--ask no questions but obey when you are told, "courtesy"
                rise &amp; bow to your master &amp; show deference to his authority over
                you--"punctuality" to always be on time--not a minute after 8, but better a minute
                before so as to give the full days labor for the pay you receive. "loyalty"--stand
                up for the man who gives your daily bread--"honesty" to come &amp; tell when you
                spoil your work, &amp; not accept full pay for poor work, making these girls a tame,
                lifeless spiritless mass, without personality or life--and as <name type="person"
                    reg="Nietzsche, Friedrich">Nietzsche</name> says a gently-grunting domestic
                animal-- My propaganda to offset this was the working girl agrees only to sell her
                    <emph rend="underline">labor</emph> to the boss--not her morality-- Its none of
                his business if she's courteous, loyal, honest dutiful obedient. She's never to
                forget that there is a war constantly going on--between her class &amp; the boss
                class--&amp; its up to her to get the largest wage for the least amount of toil
                &amp; to keep in mind a blow at his profits is a useful weapon to her class.</p>
            <p>Just as the working woman must fight for this right to retain her own morality &amp;
                psychology--so must she fight for the right to own &amp; control her own body, for
                the ownership of her own body to do with it as she desires--&amp; its no ones
                business what those desires may be.</p>
            <p>This right naturally involves a high standard of idealism as well as a knowledge of
                the prevention of disease &amp; conception. It is none of Societys business what a
                woman shall do with her body, unless she shall inflict upon Society the consequences
                of her acts, like venereal disease or offspring--then Society is concerned &amp; it
                is its right to be concerned. This then involves knowledge on these subjects both
                are important, but I wish to dwell upon only one the knowledge of the means to
                prevent conception for the working woman (both sexes).</p>
            <p>With this she should be concerned not only as an individual but also as a member of
                that class, who produce all the <add>wage</add>slaves of the world.</p>
            <p>lst Because the wages of the average man are scarcely sufficient to keep more than
                one child as it is.</p>
            <p>2nd That the cost of living is constantly increasing while wages are practically at a
                stand still.</p>
            <p>3. No matter what increase a strike will bring--one baby added to the family will
                more than <unclear>reduce the</unclear> increase even in its first year--which is
                the year it needs the least expenditure.</p>
            <p><reg resp="MSPP">4th</reg> The uncertainty of employment &amp; <reg resp="MSPP"
                    >the</reg> far reaching effect of abortions <reg resp="MSPP">when</reg> resorted
                to.</p>
            <p><reg resp="MSPP">5th</reg> The terrible loss of infant mortality
                    <unclear>among</unclear> the working people today--Something like 85,000 death
                of infants under one year old in one state <reg resp="MSPP">alone</reg>. A little
                army slaughtered by the carelessness of an indifferent Society.</p>
            <p>6th <reg resp="MSPP">While</reg> child labor exists she should not add a child slave
                to its perpetuation. </p>
            <p>7th That it is 9 out of ten girls living the life of the underworld who come from
                parents who had large families &amp; whose fathers belonged to the unskilled &amp;
                unorganized laborers.</p>
            <p>8th Societys attitude toward the workers offspring is entirely an alleviation of
                present day misery &amp; ignorance. Rather than go to the root of the question
                    <unclear>&amp; can</unclear> refuse to have more children while Society is in
                this chaotic condition &amp; here is the means to prevent it. It <del>allows</del>
                <add>forces</add> them to remain in ignorance &amp; institutes out of their
                sentimental minds better baby funds, Little Mother leagues, milk Stations for
                babies, child nurseries for the children while the mother slaves in factories. As
                these are almost all charitable affairs--<del>it goes to</del> it is usually the
                factory owners money which supports the child nurseries while the mother heaps up
                profits for him. These &amp; hundreds of other reasons why the working woman should
                have this knowledge &amp; use it. In <name type="place">England</name> you have the
                Mothers Pensions &amp; I should think it would be a slap in the face to a self
                respecting woman to have offered to her the small miserable sum to keep her child
                the few weeks after it is born. These are growing popular in USA too, &amp; no doubt
                they will soon be an established thing there soon too, &amp; I have no doubt but
                that the working class will rise &amp; bow, with hat in hand with a 'thank you sir'
                attitude &amp; accept another crumb from the table &amp; be content still a little
                longer.</p>
            <p>Out of this agitation in the <title type="journal">Woman Rebel</title> (which issue
                as it came out was successively confiscated by the <name type="org"
                    reg="United States Post Office">P.O.</name> &amp; our moral guardian <name
                    type="person" reg="Comstock, Anthony">Anthony Comstock</name>), came the
                organization of the Birth Control Leagues throughout the U.S. So far there are five
                reaching from coast to coast &amp; promise an agitation among the workers on this
                subject which should have marked results in the next four or five years. The
                propaganda is not a one-sided neo malthusian doctrine--it is one rounded out with
                the workers economic moral &amp; psychological attitude. It is full of vitality
                &amp; intense with indignation anger &amp; contempt. The object is to inject into
                the working woman a class independence which says to the masters produce your own
                slaves--keep your religion your ethics &amp; your morality for yourselves-- Ill have
                none of it &amp; we refuse to be longer enslaved by it for we are creating our own
                &amp; are building up a new Society through the process of which we are creating our
                own morality &amp; individuality.</p>
